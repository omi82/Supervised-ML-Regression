## Supervised-ML-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning regression model developed to predict the stock price of Yes Bank based on historical data.
# **Project Summary -**  This project aims to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stocks using supervised machine learning regression techniques. The project utilizes various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

**Data Preprocessing:**

1. Import the dataset containing historical stock prices.
2. Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and selecting relevant features.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

1. Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. Train various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
3. Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like mean squared error, R-squared score, and mean absolute error.

**Visualization:**

1. Plot the actual closing prices and predicted closing prices for the test set.
2. Compare the performance of different models and select the best performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

**Conclusion:**

The project successfully demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning regression techniques for predicting the closing price of Yes Bank stocks. The best performing model is chosen based on its accuracy andgeneralizability.
